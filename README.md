# High School Thesis

This is a repo containing two works for my high school thesis, back in 2015.
At that time i didn't know what it would mean programming, i didn't know the existence of GitHub & Co., IntelliJIdea or Eclipse or NetBeans and so on.  
All of the code you view it was written using JCreator (free edition of course), and even if it's not comparable with the ones mentioned above, it is for me like my first car: unforgettable.  
Maybe one day i'll comment over the entire project.  
So, back to the repo; it contains two folders:
* Modulation: it draws modulated signals choosen by the user.
* Simplex: it resolves linear programming problems specified by the user using the simplex algorithm. The algorithm used in this project was developed not properly knowing what i was doing, in fact all the mathematics involved in it was perfectioned in university
See ya!
