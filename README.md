# High School Thesis

This is a repo containing two works for my high school thesis, back in 2015.
At that time i didn't know what it would mean programming, i didn't know the existence of GitHub & Co., IntelliJIdea or Eclipse or NetBeans and so on.  
All of the code you view it was written using JCreator (free edition of course), and even if it's not comparable with the ones mentioned above, it is  
for me like my first car: unforgettable.
Maybe one day i'll comment over the entire project.
See ya!
